# Deployment Guide ($0 / free-tier)

Everything here can be hosted **free**. v1 is live today on GitHub Pages; v2 adds free-tier hosting for the
backend, database, and LLM.

## v1 — GitHub Pages (live now, zero setup)

1. Push the repo to GitHub (public).
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → `main` → `/ (root)` → Save.**
3. ~1 minute later your site is live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`
   (currently **https://antarabarman.github.io/Decode_Your_Pattern/**).

`index.html` is served at the root, so the article loads first and links into the assessment. No build, no
secrets, no cost.

> Tip: the live URL is tied to the username + repo name. Don't rename either after sharing, or the link breaks.

### Activating the feedback form (one-time, free)

The "Help Us Improve" feedback form at the end of the report is wired to send submissions via
[Formspree](https://formspree.io), a free form-to-inbox service, so no backend is needed:

1. Sign up free at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a new form.
2. Copy the form endpoint it gives you (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`).
3. In `decode-your-pattern_6.html`, find the line:
   ```js
   const FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
   ```
   and replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your real form ID.
4. Commit and push. From then on, every submitted feedback form emails you directly, and all past
   submissions are also viewable in your Formspree dashboard.

Until this is set, feedback submissions are only saved locally in the visitor's browser (`localStorage`) —
they will **not** reach you, so this step is required before the feedback feature is truly "live."

**Free-plan limit:** Formspree's free tier caps submissions at 50 per month per form, resetting monthly.
If that's ever hit, the form detects it and tells the visitor their response is saved locally and to try
again in a few days, rather than losing it silently. If you outgrow 50/month, Formspree's paid plans raise
that cap.

## v2 — full stack on free tiers

| Layer | Free host | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend (React) | **Vercel** or GitHub Pages | `vercel deploy`; static output |
| Backend (FastAPI) | **Render** or **Fly.io** free tier | one small container; `Dockerfile` provided in Phase B |
| Database | **Supabase** or **Neon** (free Postgres) | `SQLite` for local dev |
| LLM (AI Coach) | **Groq** or **Google Gemini** free tier | key stored **only** as a backend env var |
| Analytics | **PostHog** (free) or GA | aggregate, anonymous events only |

### Backend environment variables (`.env`, never committed)

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...        # Supabase/Neon connection string
JWT_SECRET=change-me
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
LLM_API_KEY=...                      # Groq/Gemini free-tier key
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<username>.github.io,https://<app>.vercel.app
```

A committed **`.env.example`** documents these without real values. The real `.env` is git-ignored.

### Deploy steps (Phase B)

```bash
# Backend (Render)
#   1. New Web Service → connect repo → root: /backend
#   2. Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
#   3. Start: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
#   4. Add the env vars above in the Render dashboard.

# Frontend (Vercel)
#   1. Import repo → root: /frontend
#   2. Build: npm run build   Output: dist/
#   3. Env: VITE_API_BASE=https://<app>.onrender.com/api/v1
```

### CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push: linting and validation today, extended in Phase B to
`pytest`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `ruff`, `black`, and `eslint`. Deploys can be wired to Render/Vercel's
git integration (auto-deploy on merge to `main`).

## Security checklist before going live

- [ ] LLM and OAuth secrets are in host env vars, **never** in the repo.
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (CORS) is restricted to your real domains.
- [ ] Analytics is aggregate/anonymous only.
- [ ] Guest mode stores no PII.
- [ ] See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
